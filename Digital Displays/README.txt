This program takes input in the form:

   + +--+ +--+ +  + +--+ +--+ +--+ +--+ +--+ +--+ 
   |    |    | |  | |    |       | |  | |  | |  | 
   |    |    | |  | |    |       | |  | |  | |  | 
   + +--+ +--+ +--+ +--+ +--+    + +--+ +--+ +  + 
   | |       |    |    | |  |    | |  |    | |  | 
   | |       |    |    | |  |    | |  |    | |  | 
   + +--+ +--+    + +--+ +--+    + +--+ +--+ +--+
