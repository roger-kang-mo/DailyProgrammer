My first real anything in python lately (read: 3-4 years)

Gettin' my chops back! And I don't mean the ones on the sides of my face.

...because I can't grow them let alone pull them off (._.)

Anyway, this code reads in the specified file and reverses everything.
Then, it spits it out to another file: 'reversed' + original_filename.txt.
