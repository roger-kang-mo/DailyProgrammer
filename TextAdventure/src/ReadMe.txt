This was the result of having my laptop in front of me while chatting with a friend.

I was helping him with an OS project and I figured I wouldn't have the focus I needed to do anything really productive.
So, I thought I'd make a text adventure game.

I didn't spend any time really thinking about it. I liken this code to a coding version of 'free writing'.

Free writing! You know, where you put your pen down to the paper and you just write. That's it and that's all. You might end up with a page filled with 'blah blah blah', but you probably won't because your mind/creativity/subconscious will take over at some point.

I hope to finish this sometime in the future. It'll be a fun little game to send to friends.
